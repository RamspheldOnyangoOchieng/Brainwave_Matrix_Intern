# Week 1 Progress Report - ATM Interface Project

## Introduction
The ATM Interface project is a sophisticated Flask-based banking system that provides a comprehensive set of banking operations through a RESTful API. The project demonstrates advanced implementation of security features, user management, and transaction processing.

## Problems Addressed
1. Secure user authentication and session management
2. Real-time transaction processing
3. Rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. Data validation and sanitization
5. API documentation and testing
6. Password security and reset functionality

## Milestones Met
1. Core Infrastructure
   - Implemented Flask application with proper project structure
   - Set up Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
   - Configured logging system
   - Established database connection and models

2. Authentication System
   - Implemented secure login system with rate limiting
   - Created password reset functionality
   - Added token-based authentication
   - Implemented PIN hashing for security

3. User Management
   - Created user registration system
   - Implemented user profile management
   - Added user data validation
   - Set up user session handling

4. Banking Operations
   - Implemented account balance checking
   - Added deposit functionality
   - Created withdrawal system
   - Implemented fund transfer between accounts
   - Added transaction history tracking

## Technical Stack
1. Backend Framework:
   - Flask (Python web framework)
   - Flask-Swagger-UI for API documentation

2. Database:
   - Supabase integration
   - Custom database service layer

3. Security Features:
   - JWT token authentication
   - Password hashing
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation

4. Development Tools:
   - Git for version control
   - Pytest for testing
   - Logging system
   - Environment variable management

## Current Progress
1. API Endpoints Implemented:
   - Authentication endpoints (/auth/*)
   - User management endpoints (/users/*)
   - Account operations (/accounts/*)
   - Transaction history

2. Security Features:
   - Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
   - Password hashing
   - Token-based authentication
   - Input validation

3. Documentation:
   - Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
   - README with setup instructions
   - Code comments and docstrings

## Next Steps
1. Enhanced Security:
   - Implement two-factor authentication
   - Add IP-based blocking
   - Enhance password policies

2. Additional Features:
   - Account statement generation
   - Transaction categorization
   - Email notifications
   - Mobile number verification

3. Testing and Optimization:
   - Increase test coverage
   - Performance optimization
   - Load testing
   - Security audit

## Challenges and Solutions
1. Challenge: Secure Authentication
   Solution: Implemented JWT tokens with rate limiting and password hashing

2. Challenge: Data Validation
   Solution: Created comprehensive validation schemas using Pydantic models

3. Challenge: API Documentation
   Solution: Integrated Swagger UI with detailed endpoint documentation

## Timeline
- Week 1: Core functionality and basic security (Completed)
- Week 2: Enhanced security and additional features
- Week 3: Testing and optimization
- Week 4: Documentation and deployment

## Conclusion
The first week has seen significant progress in implementing a robust ATM interface with essential banking operations. The foundation is solid with proper security measures, user management, and transaction processing capabilities. The project is well-structured and follows best practices in terms of code organization and security implementation.
